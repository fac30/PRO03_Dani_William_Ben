# Submitting a new Issue

Everyone is welcome to submit a new Issue to this project - whether you intend to resolve it yourself or would just like to raise the awareness to it. However, this is an example project and will not be in active development after November 2024.

## Before you submit an Issue

Check the backlog for any duplicates - it's possible that someone has already submitted the same issue you've just spotted and having duplicates in the backlog can lead to confusion and a slowdown in development


## How to submit an Issue

Once you reach the **Issues** tab on the PRO03_Dani_William_Ben repo and create a new Issue you will be prompted with a template in the **New Issue Description** - please stick to this format and fill in as much detail as possible where prompted.

Include a clear example of the current behaviour with (as much as possible):

- A way to reproduce the problem
- Screenshots of the behaviour
- Information on any triage you've attempted
